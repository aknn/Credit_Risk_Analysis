# Credit-Risk-Anaytics-The-R-Companion
The rep contains the R files from Credit Risk Analytics: the R Companion, by H Scheule, D Rosch an B Baesens. Unfortunately, when I bought the book, I could not find the R files accompanying the book. So I decided to create the R files from the snippets of codes in the book. Hope you find the files useful.
